# Customer-Market-Segmentation <br />

In this project, I trained unsupervised machine learning algorithms to perform consumer market segmentation. That was needed in order to launch targeted ad marketing campaigns according to customer's demands. <br />

The project is devided into 6 main tasks: <br />
1.Understand the theory and intuition behind k-means clustering machine learning algorithm. <br />
2.Learn how to obtain the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method. <br />
3.Use Scikit-Learn library to find the optimal number of clusters using elbow method. <br />
4.Apply k-means using Scikit-Learn to perform customer segmentation. <br />
5.Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to perform dimensionality reduction and data visualization. <br />

# Customer-Market-Segmentation <br />

In this project, I trained unsupervised machine learning algorithms to perform consumer market segmentation. That was needed in order to launch targeted ad marketing campaigns according to customer's demands. <br />

The project is devided into 5 main tasks: <br />
1.Understanding the theory and intuition behind k-means clustering machine learning algorithm. <br />
2.Learning how to obtain the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method. <br />
3.Using Scikit-Learn library to find the optimal number of clusters using elbow method. <br />
4.Applying k-means using Scikit-Learn to perform customer segmentation. <br />
5.Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to perform dimensionality reduction and data visualization. <br />
